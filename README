## Using the widgets

Every example is a set of files that you only need to upload on you app on stamplay.com.

In order to start clone this repository :

    git clone git@github.com:Stamplay/stamplay-tutorials

Or download it as a zip file
	
	https://github.com/Stamplay/stamplay-tutorials/archive/master.zip 

 upload the frontend files in your app and you can do it in two ways:

* Copy/Upload them via the Layout section of your app on Stamplay editor
* Get Stamplay Sync on [OSX](http://cdn.stamplay.com/stamplay-sync/mac/stamplay-sync.zip) or [PC](http://cdn.stamplay.com/stamplay-sync/win/stamplay-sync.zip) and run it. Make it download the frontend assets of your app and then replace them with the ones you got from this repo. Stamplay Sync will upload everything for you on your app.
